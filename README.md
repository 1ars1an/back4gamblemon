# design docs

### project

i wanna learn how to create an api, scaling and caching (all that jazz)

### features

initial steps: i wanna understand the workflow that goes behind this

- [x] add custom user model
- [x] setup database schema since serializers are based off models
- [x] setup my serializers
- [x] setup my views
- [x] setup my url configs

initial steps completed, now moving on to permissions and authentication

- [x] added jwt authentication on backend
- [x] extended jwt authentication to store tokens in cookies, made necessary changes to my token views as well

### to do's

- [] setup filtering for cleaner api access?
- [] setup pagination to reduce payloads on cards especially

### notes

##### pokeAPI modeling

- pokemon: id, order, name, base_experience, abilities, forms, moves, sprites, stats, types
